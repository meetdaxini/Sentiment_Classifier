I built a sentiment classifier as part of the Coursera [Python 3 Programming Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/C2XVUU6PXKBY). My jupyter notebook explores synthetic semi-randomly generated twitter data in a csv file named project_twitter_data.csv which has the text of a tweet, the number of retweets of that tweet, and the number of replies to that tweet. I have also created a csv file, which contains columns for the Number of Retweets, Number of Replies, Positive Score (which is how many happy words are in the tweet), Negative Score (which is how many angry words are in the tweet), and the Net Score for each tweet. At the end, I have produced a graph of the Net Score vs Number of Retweets using pandas and plotly.
